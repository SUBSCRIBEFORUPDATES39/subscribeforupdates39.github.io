# 🌟 pic32cm-pl10-mvio-interfacing-industrial-sensor-4-20ma-tx-vscode - Easily Interface Industrial Sensors

## 💻 Overview
This example, developed on the PIC32CM-PL10 CNano, showcases the use of the MVIO feature in the PIC32CM-PL10 family. It aims to help users connect and manage industrial sensors that operate at different voltage levels than the 4-20mA current loop transmitter. The project highlights a straightforward approach to interfacing these sensors while ensuring compatibility with 5V microcontrollers.
